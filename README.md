# android_vocab-blaster

This is an Android app available in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superbrown.vocabBlaster

I developed it to help my son study for his fifth and sixth grade Vocabulary classes.

The design of this may look overly complex in places; and for the strict purposes of this app, it is.  Vocab-Blaster is an
Android port of my web based Super-Spell application (https://github.com/superbrown/gwt_super-spell).  Super-Spell includes
multiple study modules -- not just vocabulary.  I stripped out what wasn't needed from Super-Spell, but some unecessary design
complexity remained.  There really wasn't a reason to spend time removing it.  The main goal was to get a working version on
Android.
