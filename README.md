# android_vocab-blaster

This is an Android app available in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superbrown.vocabBlaster

I developed it to help my son study for his fifth and sixth grade Vocabulary classes.

This is a port of my Super Spell app (https://github.com/superbrown/gwt_super-spell).  That app supported multiple study
modules -- not just vocabulary.  As a result, the design of this may look overly complex in places.  For the strict purposes of
this app, it is.  I quicly stripped out what wasn't needed, but thre's still some design complexity "residue" from the Super
Spell application.  The is no reason to spend time removing it.
