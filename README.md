# android_vocab-blaster

This is an Android app available in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superbrown.vocabBlaster

I developed it to help my son study for his fifth and sixth grade Vocabulary classes.

This is a port of my web based Super Spell app (https://github.com/superbrown/gwt_super-spell).  That app supported multiple
study modules -- not just vocabulary.  Accordingly, the design of this may look overly complex in places; and for the strict
purposes of this app, it is.  I quickly stripped out what wasn't needed from Super Spell, but some unecessary design complexity
remained.  There just wasn't a reason to spend time removing it.  The main goal was to get it working in Android.
